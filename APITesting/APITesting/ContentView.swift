     var name = "Taylor"
 }
 
 for classes we  get funky stuff when we try storing it as a json
 we need to first let user follow the codable protocol
 
 next is to hand the weird naming: we need to tell swift exactly how to encode and decode
 this can be done by nesting an enum called CodingKeys which will ne a string and confirms
 to CodingKey next for each weird label we get we need to make a case to switch it to what we want to store
